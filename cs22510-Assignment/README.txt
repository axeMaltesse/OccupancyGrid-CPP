This README file is about files in cs22510-Assignment and my project in C++ language.

Folder contains following files:

CMakeLists.txt -> created by Clion IDE to execute the project
main.cpp -> main class
OccupancyGrid.cpp -> class contains information about grid
OccupancyGrid.h -> header file of the class
Position.h -> header file declares two structures
poses.txt -> file from blackboard
ranges.txt -> file from blackboard

1. How to run:

Linux: compile files by command

g++ -Wall -std=c++11 main.cpp OccupancyGrid.cpp

Windows: Using IDE like Visual Studio or Clion and import folder with files after. Then build and run solution. 

When you run the program make sure that you are following the hints or program will close itself!

2. Standard liblarieas, header files and packages I used:

iostream
ostream
vector
fstream
math.h
